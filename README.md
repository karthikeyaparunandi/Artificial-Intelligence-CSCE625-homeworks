# Artificial-Intelligence-CSCE625-homeworks
Repository of my homeworks to some interesting problems given in the homeworks of CSCE 625 course on Artifical Intelligence.
- Home work-1 throws some light on how to write program in a functional programming paradigm. This has a simple implementation of Breadth First Search in Scheme programming language (Gambit implementation). 
- Home work-2 is an interesting Jigshaw kind of puzzle. It first drives home the point that representation is a very important component in such problems. Second, since there are a thousands of solutions and millions of nodes in the tree, techniques for pruning the search comes into play. I have implemented a DFS in Python with a number of problem-specific and general pruning techniques, which drastically reduced the space complexity.
